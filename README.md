It's Mad Games Tycoon 2 mod. The mod allows rebalance Marketing of your games with config by yourself! Also Hype limit adjustable by yourself!

# [How it works?]
This mod allows rebalance Marketing of your games.

For now, the following these settings can be adjusted.<br>
<br>
# [Basic Settings]
1. Maximum hype limit each ads type.
2. Add hype each ads type.
3. Work Points(Workspeed) each ads type. *The more, the more time to put ads.
4. Price each ads type.

# [Additional Settings]
