# Marketing-Rebalancer
It's Mad Games Tycoon 2 mod. The mod allows rebalance Marketing of your games with config by yourself! Also Hype limit adjustable by yourself!

# [How it works?]
This mod allows rebalance Marketing of your games.
<br>
For now, the following these settings can be adjusted.<br>
<br>
<Basic Settings>
1. Maximum hype limit each ads type.
2. Add hype each ads type.
3. Work Points(Workspeed) each ads type. *The more, the more time to put ads.
4. Price each ads type.

<Additional Settings>
1. Maximum Hype Limit *Original hype limit is 100, but now you CAN adjust it!
2. Border line of Bombastic advertisement
3. Customized Overhype <br>
*Overhype of Special Marketing adds additional points for hype. **Original overhype makes forcibly 200 hypes but it adds additional points instead.
